                  Engineering has existed since ancient times, when humans
                  devised inventions such as the wedge, lever, wheel and pulley,
                  etc. The term engineering is derived from the word engineer,
                  which itself dates back to the 14th century when an engineer
                  (literally, one who builds or operates a siege engine)
                  referred to â€œa constructor of military engines.
